# Icestorm install scripts

Getting the [ICEstick Evaluation Kit](http://www.latticesemi.com/icestick) working with the [Project IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) toolchain.    

Good @jonathanjo over at the South London Makerspace ran the workshop and loaned me an ICEstick. I condensed [his notes](https://discourse.southlondonmakerspace.org/t/electronics-gate-array-workshop-notes-lattice-ice40/4861) to run the install and example off a single script.  

To replicate the steps, plug the ICEStick in, clone repo, cd into lattice/scripts and run  

```
. install-tools.sh
```

All being well the circular blinking LED example will be running on the ICEStick.
